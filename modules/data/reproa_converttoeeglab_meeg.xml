        subject can be specified as cell array of strings or '*' (for all)
        to modify events or data
            event can be a single event or a 1xN array indicating events in the event list
            valid operations are
                'remove' - remove
                'keep' - remove all others
                'unique:first' - keep only first of consecutive events
                'unique:last' - keep only last of consecutive events
                'rename:<new type>' - rename event(s) to <new type>
                'iterate' - add suffix to recurring event to indicate the number of occurrence
                'insert:[<array of indices>] - insert event before the locations specified by <array of indices> with timings of the events at the locations'
                'ignorebefore' - remove heading data before the first occurence (excluding the event)
                'ignoreafter' - remove trailig data after the last occurence (including the event)
